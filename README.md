# Hospital Emergency Room Simulation

This is a simulation of a hospital emergency room using SimPy and Tkinter. The simulation models the arrival, triage, and treatment of patients in an emergency room setting.

## Features

- Generates patients with random arrival times, ages, and triage levels.
- Models patient flow through waiting, triage, and treatment processes.
- Simulates the allocation of doctors based on patient triage levels.
- Displays simulation output in a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
- Provides statistics on patient wait times, treatment times, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 and above
- SimPy
- Tkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
